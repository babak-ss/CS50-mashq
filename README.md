# CS50-mashq

A repository containing my answers to Harvard's CS50 online course problem sets and labs.

Disclamer:
All the exercises in this repository have been tested solely with the provided test cases. We cannot guarantee that the course's style checks and other tests will work correctly with these scripts.

"Mashq" means homework in persian.
